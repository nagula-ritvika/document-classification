### document-classification-task

In this project, I have trained a Random Forest Classifier on documents containing hashed data. I have created a Flask app
which takes in an input document and tries to classify it based on the target labels available at training time.

The model is deployed and can be tested at https://rnagula-document-classifier.herokuapp.com.
